Project Description:

The aim of this project is to systematically identify and catalogue issues related to serial numbers within our product data. The focus is twofold:

detecting missing serial numbers that are crucial for inventory tracking, customer service, and warranty claims, and

identifying serial numbers that deviate from the established format of two numbers followed by two alphabets (e.g., 23AB).

These anomalies undermine data integrity and can lead to operational inefficiencies.

Objectives:

Data Analysis: Utilize scripts to sift through our dataset, flagging entries with missing serial numbers or those that do not conform to the expected format.

Issue Categorization: Separate detected issues into two distinct categories for targeted resolution - missing serial numbers and unstructured serial numbers.

Correction Strategy: Develop a strategy for correcting detected issues, potentially involving data entry guidelines, automated correction algorithms, or targeted manual review.
